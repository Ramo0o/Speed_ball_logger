## **Introduction**

**Speedball Logger** was created after a request from my speedball coach to enhance the efficiency of our data entry process. Previously, our coach would manually record ball hit counts, consuming around 60 hours a month. This website revolutionizes the process by allowing players to quickly enter their data, which is then stored and managed in a database. Now, data retrieval is at the coachâ€™s fingertips anytime it's needed.

## **Features**

- **Efficient Data Entry**: Players can enter their ball hit counts in seconds.
- **Database Management**: Utilizes SQLite with indexes and views to optimize data storage and retrieval.
- **Login System**: New feature in version 2.0 to secure access.
- **Admin Panel**: Ongoing development to provide comprehensive management tools.
- **Improved UI**: Redesigned interface for a cleaner and more intuitive user experience.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Design**: Background created with Canva

## **Usage**

Once set up, players can log their ball hit counts through the website interface. Coaches can access the stored data anytime. The site is currently live [link placeholder] and available for use by my speedball team members. For access, please contact me.

## **License**

This project is open for use under the condition of prior approval. Please contact me before using it for any purposes outside of the speedball team.
